This is a simple Todo List application built with React, Redux, and Axios. The application allows users to create, update, and delete tasks within different todo lists. It leverages a backend server to persist data,
ensuring that the state of todo lists and their items is consistent across sessions.

Features:
  1)Add a New List: Enter the title of the new list in the input field and click the "Add List" button.
  2)Add Items to a List: Enter the item title in the input field within a list and click the "Add" button.
  3)Edit an Item: Change the text of an item directly in the textarea.
  4)Delete an Item: Click the trash icon next to an item to delete it.

      cd toDoNode
  Install backend dependencies:
      npm install
  Create a .env file in the backend directory and add the following:
      PORT=5000
      MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/todolist
  Start the backend server:
      npm start
  Run the frontend application:
